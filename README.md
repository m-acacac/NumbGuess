This game is very similar to WORDLE, except with numbers and an infinite length capacity. To start, you input the 
amount of digits you want in your PIN, and then your first guess. Correct guesses will be highlighted green. Incorrect 
guesses will be red. Guesses in the wrong place will be yellow. Guess until your final PIN is correct.
